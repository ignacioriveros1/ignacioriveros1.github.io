Before going to graduate school, I worked as a *data scientist* at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/){:target="_blank"}. This organization's primary purpose is to leverage information technologies and underused administrative data to deliver precise and legible information to improve decision-making in educational markets. My main task was to develop software pieces to clean administrative data, match many students and schools in centralized school systems, and develop APIs to deliver information for the organization's web services (recommendation systems, report cards, chatbots).

Meanwhile, I worked as an independent researcher with scholars from the Catholic University of Chile. In the first one, we studied the medium-term impact of the 2010 Earthquake in Chile on the economic activity of the country's most affected municipalities. In the second one, we explore the politics of equalization grants in Chile. Check them in my [research]({{site.base_url}}/research/)!.

I have several hobbies. I love to practice sports (I'm always open to this type of invitation). In particular, I like to play tennis, road cycling, surfing, climbing, and running. Also, I enjoy cooking, primarily Chilean food.
