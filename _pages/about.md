(/assets/cv/CV_2.pdf)[CV]

I'm a Chilean data scientist and economist. My main interests are related to the generation and application of knowledge and information technology to improve people's lives through evidence-based public policy.

I worked as a data scientist at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/). Here, I worked together with a fantastic [team](https://www.consiliumbots.com/team-1), leveraging information technologies and underused administrative data to deliver precise and legible information to improve decision making in educational markets. I wrote several software pieces to clean data, match students and schools, simulate congestion in centralized school systems, and recommend college options. As a bonus, with Consilium's team, we participated in a fantastic project about [COVID-19 and Small Businesses](https://covid19sbs.org/).

In parallel, I have been working as a part-time researcher in a joint project of the [Public Policy School](http://gobierno.uc.cl/es/) at the Catholic University of Chile and [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/). In this research project, we study the medium-term impact of the 2010 Earthquake in Chile on most affected counties' economic activity. The primary purpose of this project is to build resilience against *socio-natural disasters*.

I have several hobbies. In the first place, I like computers and programming. I consider myself an amateur programmer, being `python` my favorite language. I also have experience coding in `rstats` and `stata`. Also, I love to practise sports. I practice bouldering and sport climbing, and I am discovering the world of road cycling.
