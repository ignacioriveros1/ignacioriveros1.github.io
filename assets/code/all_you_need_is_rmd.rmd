## Introduction

- 1) Diversity of options to write research papers or academic slides.
    - Word, Latex

- 2) Separation between manuscript and code
    - Increase the risk of typing errors.
    - Increase the amount of work spent in non-statics atributes (i.e. figures and tables in word).
    - The reproducibility of the paper become more difficult.

- 3) A solution: `Rmarkdown`
    - Execute R, Python or Stata in one place to produce your statistical analysis.
    - Use $\LaTeX$ for equations and more!
    - Markdown syntax for the body of the text.
    - Configure the document with a `YAML` header.
