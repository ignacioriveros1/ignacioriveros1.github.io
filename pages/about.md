# About Me

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/profile.jpg">

My name is Ignacio Riveros, I’m a (project of) economist, with research interests in labor, education and public economics.

I’m working in ConsiliumBots developing algorithms to give information about tertiary education alternatives in developing countries as the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Chile.

Also, I’m a part-time researcher in a joint project of the Public Policy School at Catholic University of Chile and CIGIDEN. This project is about economic activity consequences of the 2010 earthquake in Chile. I hold an MSc in Applied Economics and a B.A in economics at the University of Chile.
