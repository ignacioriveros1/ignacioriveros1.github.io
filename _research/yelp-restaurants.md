abstract:  "This paper explores the short- and long-run consequences of the pandemic on the restaurant industry. Using Yelp restaurant reviews as a measure of quality and Safegraph data to estimate the number of restaurant workers and visits (dine-in or takeout), we present several findings.
We show that restaurant visits decreased substantially at the beginning of the pandemic but gradually recovered over time, reaching pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, restaurants suffered a permanent reduction in the number of workers that started with the beginning of the pandemic and continues to this day. Turning to quality, we find that restaurants' average ratings increased in the short-run. However, in the long-run, ratings decreased to below pre-pandemic levels. To explain these findings, we analyze the text of the reviews. We find evidence consistent with consumers writing five-star reviews to support local businesses at the beginning of the pandemic, which can explain the sudden short-run jump in ratings. In the long run, we find many more one-star reviews complaining about service issues, consistent with restaurants being short-staffed and offering lower service quality.
Finally, by regressing the number of workers and ratings, we find a positive relationship between the two measures, suggesting that labor shortage can indeed explain part of the decrease in restaurants' average ratings."
