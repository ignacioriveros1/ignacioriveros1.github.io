abstract: "This research aims to empirically investigate whether and how brands' sociopolitical stands shape customer store visits in the US. We explore answers to the following questions: (1) How has the political polarization in stores' clientele composition evolved over the last few years (2019-2022) in the US? (2) Whether brands' sociopolitical stands play a role in this evolution? (3) If so, are store visits of certain brands sensitive to particular types of sociopolitical events? We use foot traffic data to identify brands' physical stores and track visits to their stores, detailed by which census block groups consumers come from. Second, we utilize voting data at the precinct level of the 2020 presidential election to capture political preference heterogeneity. We then merge these two data sets to create a novel and granular measure of the political customer profile for each store and week between 2019 and 2022. Third, we gauge the stands of a large number of brands on all significant sociopolitical events during this period based on conversations on social media. We further examine the extent to which customer store visits vary based on the sociopolitical stands of these brands. This study expands upon previous research by offering insights into whether and how US consumers from a large and diverse set of popular brands alter their store visit behavior in response to these brands' stands on various sociopolitical events."
