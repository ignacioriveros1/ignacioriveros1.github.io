abstract: "This study investigates the impact of short-term rentals (STRs) on property-related crimes. We use a dataset of approximately half a million properties listed on Airbnb between 2008 and 2019 in 12 selected cities and incident-level crime data to answer the research question. Using STRs regulations across different cities as a source of exogenous variation for the supply of Airbnb, we present several findings. First, the direct association between Airbnb supply and crime incidence suggests a negative correlation between property crime and Airbnb supply, indicating that reducing the number of Airbnb listings in a neighborhood may coincide with increasing property crime. Second, after the implementation of STR regulations, the supply of Airbnb decreased considerably, and the number of property crimes increased in the medium run (6 to 12 months)."
