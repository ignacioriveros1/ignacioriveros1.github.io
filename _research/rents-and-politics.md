abstract: Existing literature concurs that intergovernmental transfers breed rentierism when local governments receive more money in fiscal transfers than what they contribute in taxes to fund those grants. Nonetheless, there is a mismatch between the concept of fiscal rentierism and existing measures, which take the whole transfers local governments receive, lumping together tax and nontax income. We study the Fondo Común Municipal (FCM), an equalization grant in Chile, and provide a novel measure of fiscal rents that identifies what corresponds to a subsidy and, therefore, to nontax income. We revisit the rentier hypotheses, comparing the effects of FCM transfer and FCM subsidy on different outcomes. Our findings confirm that fiscal rents increase incumbency advantage. Additionally, we find that the association between rents and competitiveness disappears when using FCM subsidy. Lastly, both measures increase public spending. However, for all of our outcomes, FCM transfer significantly overestimates the effects of fiscal rents.
