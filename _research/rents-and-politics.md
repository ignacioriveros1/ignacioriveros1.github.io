abstract: Extant literature concurs that fiscal transfers affect governance when they grant subnational governments nontax revenue. Nonetheless, there is a mismatch between the concept of fiscal rents and existing measures, which consider the whole transfers local governments receive, including both tax and nontax revenue. We study the Fondo Común Municipal (FCM), the most important intergovernmental grant in Chile, and provide a novel measure of nontax revenue. We use this new measure alongside the whole FCM transfer to test the rentier hypothesis. On the one hand, we show that both measures increase the incumbent party vote share, although the effect of our measure is substantially smaller. On the other hand, we find that the FCM transfer has a strong impact on the probability of reelection and the competitiveness of elections, but this effect disappears when using our measure. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal rents do not lead to strong electoral dominance.
