abstract: 'Strong earthquakes generate immediate economic impacts on the affected areas. Existing research however, is inconclusive regarding their longer-term effects. We examine the medium-run impacts of the 2010 earthquake in Chile, the sixth-largest seismic event ever recorded, drawing on a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the random variation across differently affected municipalities. Using VAT collection as a proxy for economic activity at the municipal level and a novel measure of local ground-shaking intensity, we find that the affected municipalities suffered a relevant and persistent drop in their economic activity. Our results show that VAT collection was 20% lower in treated than control municipalities eight years later. Additionally, the most negatively affected municipalities were more densely populated, educated, urban, and affluent and had more capital-intensive activities. In these municipalities, firms’ sales and employment declined, and the ratio of large to small firms dropped, suggesting that the capital stock stayed below the pre-event trend.'
