My name is Ignacio Riveros, I’m a (project of) economist, with research interests in labor, education and public economics. Also, I'm big fan of computers and statistical programming, with focus on data science oriented to solve relevant public policy issues.

I’m working in [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/) developing algorithms to provide information about tertiary education alternatives to students from developing countries as the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Chile.

Also, I’m a part-time researcher in a joint project of the [Public Policy School](http://gobierno.uc.cl/es/) at Catholic University of Chile and [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/). This project is about economic activity consequences of the 2010 earthquake in Chile. I hold an MSc in Applied Economics and a B.A in economics at the University of Chile.
