**My name is Ignacio Riveros, I’m a chilean (project of) economist and data scientist.**  My main interests are related to the generation and application of knowledge and technology to improve people's life through public policy. You can check my CV [here](cv/CV_2.pdf)!

I’m working at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/), bringing together economics and data science towards to improve educational outcomes of people. We are focused on use (and create) evidence about decision making in education, and how precise and legible information can lead to better decisions and outcomes. Also, we are working as consultants in many LAC countries together with the IADB to boost the use of centralized school mechanism by educational policy makers. Check our amazing [team](https://www.consiliumbots.com/team-1)!

In this context, my main contributions have been the design and implementation of school matching softwares, together with simulators to understand the consequences of different types of applications in the context of centralized school assignment mechanisms. Also, I have been involved in the implementation of chatbots and web-platforms oriented to provide personalized information of higher education options. As a bonus, with Consilium's team, we participated in an amazing project about [COVID-19 and Small Businesses](https://covid19sbs.org/).

Also, I’m a part-time researcher in a joint project of the [Public Policy School](http://gobierno.uc.cl/es/) at Catholic University of Chile and [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/). In this research project, we are trying to understand the medium-term impact of 2010 Earthquake in Chile on most affected counties' economic activity. The main purpose of this project is to build resilience against *socio-natural disasters*.

I have several interests. In the first place, I really like computers and programming. I consider myself an amateur programmer, being `python` my favourite language. I also have experience coding in `rstats` and `stata`. In the second place, I love to read books about real world issues. Finally, I love sports, specially rock climbing and road bike.
