## Welcome!
I’m Ignacio Riveros, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu){:target="_blank"}. I work in topics at the intersection of public policy, politics and marketing, using econometrics and causal inference to draw insights for managers and policymakers.
