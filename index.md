## Welcome!
I’m Ignacio Riveros, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu){:target="_blank"}.
My research lies at the intersection of marketing, public policy, and political economy. I use econometric and causal inference tools to understand how consumers respond to firm behavior and policy changes—especially in politically or technologically complex environments.

More recently, my projects explore how sociopolitical events, AI technologies, and infrastructure investments shape consumer behavior and brand performance across digital and physical channels. More specifically, my current projects include:
- 	How AI-generated content (AIGC) disclosures affect engagement on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
- How brands’ involvement in sociopolitical events impacts in-store foot traffic, using high-frequency mobility data.
- How urban bikeway infrastructure affects store visits to nearby businesses.

 <!-- Before joining USC, I worked as a data scientist at [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/), a non-profit Ed-tech startup. I hold a B.A. in Economics and an M.A. in Economic Analysis from the University of Chile. -->
